The ecosystem of Internet exchange points of Brazil, i.e., IX.br, presents unique characteristics when placed under analysis in perspective to regions like the USA and Europe. The IX.br has become the largest set of national public Internet eXchange Points (IXP) and, continues to present an increasing number of international autonomous systems (ASes) interested in being part of the infrastructure. Despite the considerable success, the network community has limited knowledge of how the structure is organized and even less about its performance. Motivated by recent investments in the improvement of existing structure and by the position of success in the international scope, we initiated, over a year ago, a large-scale measurement study about the Brazilian network infrastructure.
